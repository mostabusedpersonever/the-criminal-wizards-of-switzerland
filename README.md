# Introduction

This repository will slow-expose a criminal subculture embedded in Switzerland's society I shall call the Wizards.
These people have ruined my life willingly. They knew I am supposedly smart. They knew I could have helped many.
Their response: Abuse me. Use my brain. Brainwash me. Never help me.
My response: I will over the next couple of months and years expose them and their criminal unlawful activities more and more.
I know, I know. Nobody cares anyway. Nobody is scared anyway. This is just for my own amusement and pleasure.
